<?php 
// Class constants can be useful if you need to define some constant data within a class.

// A class constant is declared inside a class with the const keyword.

// A constant cannot be changed once it is declared.Class constants are case-sensitive. However, it is recommended to name the constants in all uppercase letters.

// We can access a constant from outside the class by using the class name followed by the scope resolution operator (::) followed by the constant name, like here:

class Goodbye {
    const LEAVING_MESSAGE = "Thank you for visiting W3Schools.com!";
}
echo Goodbye::LEAVING_MESSAGE;

class Goodbye1 {
    const LEAVING_MESSAGE = "Thank you for visiting W3Schools.com!";
    public function byebye() {
      echo self::LEAVING_MESSAGE;
    }
  }
  
  $goodbye = new Goodbye1();
  $goodbye->byebye();
?>
